Comment: Saga is generally licensed using two licenses:
 LGPL-2.1 for the libraries and GPL-2 for the rest of the program.
 Excluded files are non-free (triangle and firelib) or are already packaged 
 in debian (svm and dxflib). GPL-3+ licensed files like cluster_isodata.cpp
 are also excluded because the license is incompatible with GPL-2 (v2 only)
 used for most of SAGA.
Files-Excluded: src/modules/grid/grid_gridding/nn/triangle.c
 src/modules/grid/grid_gridding/nn/triangle.h
 src/modules/simulation/sim_fire_spreading/fireLib.*
